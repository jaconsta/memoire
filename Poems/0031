Which’s the meaning to be loved?
What’s this way to be owned?
When distance takes us apart
And I don’t even know how you are.

By hearing you is not enough 
With words I still don’t trust
Because promises is what I less want,
But acts that excuses your facts.

I want to see your face
Maybe you’re a princess or maybe a slave
And with your description I still don’t know
If blind my eyes or let my deserves flow

You do tell me where you go
Do ask me to leave your home
And I never regret your wish
Because I don’t care, I don’t see.

Is distance a way to love?
Has shadow a pretty shape?
Are those ways to deserve to me?
Because that’s what I don’t know.
