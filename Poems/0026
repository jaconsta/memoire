I waited for you all night 
With tears coming from my eyes
Which told me your love was far
Even when you where right
But your heart wasn’t of my own
And you weren’t coming alone.

You said you were going to be with me forever
And I thought our love was perfect,
When that one appeared 
Showing that you lied me
‘Cause with the minimum distraction
Your words got lost in action.

When we had troubles 
A kiss used to calm the moment
Getting us surrounded by passion
Who gets jealous with the law infraction
But waited quietly all the moment
Until we finished what is forbidden.

Now you’ve left me along with loneliness 
That doesn’t know what to say
Just that I must think right
Or I won’t be able to survive
And I know it is right
But I prefer to die
Before understanding the reality of live.

I’ve gone downstairs to the front door
To wait for the sound of your voice
And it’s got really late
‘Cause 15 years has gone away
And I’m still waiting for you
With my mind that doesn’t think in something to do.
